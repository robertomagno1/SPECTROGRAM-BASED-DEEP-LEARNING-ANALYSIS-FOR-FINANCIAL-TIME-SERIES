# SPECTROGRAM-BASED-DEEP-LEARNING-ANALYSIS-FOR-FINANCIAL-TIME-SERIES
This project proposes a framework for time series classification and forecasting using spectrogram representations of stock market data. 

The method integrates  advanced preprocessing techniques, including data augmentation and segmentation. Spectrograms are  generated via Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to capture both time and frequency- domain features. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that  this method achieves superior performance compared to traditional statistical and machine learning approaches.
