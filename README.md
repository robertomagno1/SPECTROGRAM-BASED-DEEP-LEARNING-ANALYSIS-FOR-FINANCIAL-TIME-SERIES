# SPECTROGRAM-BASED-DEEP-LEARNING-ANALYSIS-FOR-FINANCIAL-TIME-SERIES
This project proposes a framework for time series classification and forecasting using spectrogram representations of stock market data. 

The method integrates  advanced preprocessing techniques, including data augmentation and segmentation. Spectrograms are  generated via Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to capture both time and frequency- domain features. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that  this method achieves superior performance compared to traditional statistical and machine learning approaches.


## Overview

Conventional statistical and machine learning approaches often struggle to model the complex dynamics of financial time series. To address this gap, our project converts raw price and volume data into **spectrogram images**, enabling convolutional and transformer-based networks to discover subtle, nonlinear patterns within these representations.

> **Goal**: Achieve superior forecasting and classification accuracy on stock market time series through advanced data preprocessing and deep neural architectures specialized in image-like data.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Acquire historical stock price data (OHLCV).
   - Address missing values and outliers.

2. **Segmentation & Normalization**  
   - Divide time series into fixed-length segments (e.g., 100 days).
   - Normalize each segment to ensure consistent feature scaling.

3. **Wavelet-Based Spectrogram Creation**  
   - Apply **CWT** (e.g., Morlet wavelet) to generate 2D spectrograms.
   - Optionally perform data augmentation (random rotations, translations, etc.).

4. **Deep Learning Model**  
   - Utilize CNNs, Vision Transformers, or hybrid architectures on spectrogram images.
   - (Optional) Incorporate numerical indicators alongside the image-based inputs.

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Compare against baseline methods such as ARIMA and LSTM.
   - Use metrics like accuracy, F1-score, MSE, or RMSE as appropriate.
